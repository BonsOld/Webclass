            <li>My first impression of the website was that it is very clean cut.</li>
            <li>The website has pictures that are linked all in a bundle. It also has a 
                dropdown navbar at the top.</li>
            <li>The site structure makes sense to me because all of the links are organized the same way.</li>
            <li>The graphics and layout are helpful. When you scroll down, 
                it creates a helpful button to take you back to the top.</li>
            <li>The website didn't take super long to load, it took about 2 seconds.</li>
            <li>The website had a background picture for the main item, and it added to the site.</li>
            <li>The website had a navbar that was very helpful in finding information.</li>
            <li>The site had a look and feel that was the same in the different pages.</li>
            <li>The site performed perfectly with smaller windows.</li>
            <li>The site offered a button that takes you back to the top, which is very nice for long pages.</li>

            <li>My first impression of the website is that it has a minimalist design.</li>
            <li>The website organizes information with a navbar and scrolling down.</li>
            <li>The site's organization doesn't make sense to me because the headings 
                are small and easy to miss.</li>
            <li>The multimedia adds to the site because you get to see what the link 
                is like before you click on it.</li>
            <li>The homepage was pretty fast to load.</li>
            <li>The text color and size could've been better. The headings were really 
                small, and some of the words blended in with the picture.</li>
            <li>The site had a sticky navbar, which was nice.</li>
            <li>The look of the pages were similar to each other, but not to the homepage.</li>
            <li>The window size responsiveness worked really well for smaller pages.</li>
            <li>I think that the sticky navbar is a nice touch.</li>

            <li>The graphics layout is nice, I like the addition of the tweet window.</li>
            <li>The homepage was very quick to load.</li>
            <li>The text color and size didn't disrupt the page while reading.</li>
            <li>The page had a horizontal navbar that lead to over similar looking pages.</li>
            <li>The white color theme was the same throughout the pages.</li>
            <li>The site didn't respond at all when I changed the window size.</li>
